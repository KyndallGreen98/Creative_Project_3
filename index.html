      A Brief History of The Sims: 2000-Present
    </center> </h2>
    <p>

      <p>The Sims is one of the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Women_and_Gaming/TY3GAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1">best-selling games in video game</a> history. It continues to break records every year that a new game or expansion pack is released. Gee and Hays note that in 2009 when the third single-player Sims game was released, the game had sold over 1.4 million copies in one week. Some gamers and researchers would note it is difficult for PC games. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/02/04/how-sims-navigated-20-years-change-become-one-most-successful-franchises-ever/">Favis</a> alerts that as of 2020, the game sold over 200 million copies worldwide, with 20 million different players in The Sims community. However, The Sims has been breaking records since its release in 2000 by creator Will Wright and has gone through countless evolutions and spinoff game series. . In this article, I will detail the history of The Sims and its changes over the past twenty-one years, starting with how the game began and ending with how the world-renowned game remains relevant today.    </p>

      <p> The first Sims game was released on February 4, 2000 and was simply titled <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/51266122">The Sims</a> . Before The Sims, there was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/04/a-visual-history-of-the-sims">SimCity</a> , released in 1989. SimCity focused on urban planning and designing a city from an aerial point-of-view. Will Wright, the creator of The Sims franchise, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0739456X07305791">invented the game</a> to offer the player a simulation, where they can erect buildings, like houses or café's, build road systems, create budgets, natural disasters, with an active population that they are essentially taking care of. Gaber writes that the game simulates real life, and the people that live in SimCity are named Sims. SimCity was a commercial success, and Wright and the Maxis team created numerous sequels throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. SimCity is lauded for being realistic and showing what actual life looks like from an urban planning perspective. Some gamers mention that the entire game is like  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB951157817307760733">'playing God'</a> where you can control anything. Below is a timeline of The Sims franchise, including online, multiplayer, and Nintendo games. </p>

        <center>
        <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=16-MIyfTHSY5MM5U2WICqbTq7hQDhuj6YULyC6JnFZf4&font=Bevan-PontanoSans&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='80%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'>

        </center>

      <p>This dynamic team lead to the release of the first sims game, The Sims. The Sims was groundbreaking as it focused on the people in SimCity rather than the city itself. However, some features still exist from SimCity, like the ability to build a house and cause disasters, like fires, burglaries, and even alien abductions. Will Wright created The Sims after a house fire at his home and noted that it would be interesting for players to have more control over their Sims and decorate their homes, businesses, and lives. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118032000163268">Nutt and Railton</a> mention that The Sims game serves as a less common game genre, which is the genre of real-life. A genre is  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118032000163268">"a tacit contract . . . established through the reciprocal studio – audience relationship"</a> (p. 579). Therefore, Sims players often create their own storylines and characters to mimic and play with real life, which is similar to Wright and Maxis's intentions making the game. In real life, people can have children, get married, get promoted, die, and so much more, and The Sims serves to mimic the seemingly trivial things in life. Sims can also eat, go to the bathroom, sleep, and get stressed out, which genuinely reflects real life and its various monotonous tasks that add to it. Real-life as a genre is helpful when considering how pervasive and similar The Sims is to everyday life. Game genres serve to help us decide if the game would be interesting. The Sims allows a real-life model and encourages creativity.   </p>

      <p>In continuation, players often follow storylines for their Sims and create detailed families. Some play the game simply to make Sims and their homes. The Sims is the only game in the franchise that did not allow ageing during gameplay. You could only have a non-playable baby, child, or adult Sim. The Sims 2, which came out in 2004, added more age ranges and the ability to age as you play. The Sims 2 also contains a 3D world where the camera can tilt and spin rather than a 2D model like its predecessor. Roberts adds that <a href=" https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/51266122"> "the new game introduced 14 locations,</a> including Pleasantview and Strangetown, over 400 buildings and designing options, 350 new objects, and 10,000 available fashion options", which shows how much was updated and changed since the previous version. The game also included creating pets and sending Sims to college, which was not included in the first game. The Sims 2 soon knocked The Sims off of the top-selling game with little competition from other franchises. Below is a juxtaposition of the graphics differences in The Sims 2 and The Sims 4.  </p>

			</center>

      <p>After The Sims 2 game came The Sims 3 in 2009, which sold over a million copies in its first week. It is important to note that The Sims franchise was bought by Electronic Arts midway through The Sims 2 expansion pack production, which leads to many changes in the game development and the distancing of the game from creator Will Wright. The Sims 3 rids itself of loading screens and created an open-world design where players could easily visit Sims in different households with fewer limits. The Sims 3 indeed showed the breadth of social interactions in the game. The gameplay is still limitless, and game designers included a new feature called  <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Sims_The_Complete_Guide/5fkLAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">'Story Progression'</a>. Story Progression <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Sims_The_Complete_Guide/5fkLAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0"> "allows all Sims in the neighborhood to autonomously continue</a> as if the player was controlling them, such as grow up, get married, get jobs and promotions, have children, build or buy their dream house while the player isn't playing" (p. 89). Story Progression was a significant development that changed how players played the game as their world was constantly evolving and growing. Create-A-Sim is another feature that raised with The Sims 3, where sliders for weight, nose size, tattoo opacity and more were added, along with a complex customization section where you can change the colour, pattern, or fabric of any item.   </p>

      <p>Finally, the most recent addition to The Sims is The Sims 4, which came out in 2014 and is the longest-running Sims game in the franchise's history, with expansion packs still being created in 2021. The Sims 4 has some of the best graphics in gaming history and is often called a beautifully designed game by players and other gamers. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/04/a-visual-history-of-the-sims"> Davis</a> writes that another difference for the game is the fact that "The Sims 4 replaces the customization options of The Sims 3 with the dynamic Create-A-Sim tool, which lets players manifest their characters in more detail than any other franchise installment. It's widening the series' scope by giving the player more power than ever.  </p>

			<p>The Sims has a large community that, in some ways, makes it a PC classic, especially among women who often are not considered 'real gamers'. Nutt and Railton also note that The Sims has 'an electronic doll-house feel', which adds to the idea that it is a 'girls' game. Gee and Hays note that the game is not popular among men even though it is one of the best-selling games in history created by a man.
				Most of The Sims players are women, which can be seen on platforms like YouTube where most content creators are women. However, The Sims 4 is inclusive for gender expression and sexuality which makes the game popular in queer communities. The Sims has always had a large community where fans even create things like custom content and mods that can change the player experience and shows how active the players are. Sims 3 and 4 also included an online feature where players can upload content to a gallery, like their Sims or house builds for other players to like, download, and share. This feature allowed the community to expand and come into contact with each other and led to the EA Game Changer programs. </p>

			<p>The <a href=" https://www.ea.com/game-changers">EA Game Changer </a> program permits content creators the opportunity for early access to the game, and the option to visit Sims Camp, where they can play the game and interact with their fellow Game Changers. This is a new program in The Sims franchise but shows how ingrained the players are to the game, and how the game producers acknowledge and work around that. Because without content creators the game would not be as popular as it is. Soon, more about The Sims 5 will be released and players will have the opportunity to play a new game with countless other features.

      Playing The Sims: An Overview of Build/Buy Mode, Create-A-Sim, and Live Mode
    </center> </h2>

    <p>
      <p>The Sims is an open-ended game. The player has countless opportunities to control their Sims lives, make them happy, sad, angry, or inspired, and cause drama, fear, or any other human emotion. The Sims 4, the latest instalment of The Sims franchise, took the idea of ‘playing God’ even further than its predecessors. Players can control every aspect of their characters’ lives with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/02/04/how-sims-navigated-20-years-change-become-one-most-successful-franchises-ever/ ">cheats, mods, and custom content</a>. And although cheats and mods existed in the previous Sims games, with the long run that The Sims 4 has, there are more significant opportunities for players to make their games more detailed and unique than ever before. Mods are common in the gaming community and modify the game code to add new features or fixes. With the help of an engaged Sims community, the game has developed and improved over its almost seven years of existence. In this article, I will detail the game’s main features combined with commentary from Sims players on Twitter. </p>

      <p>When a player first opens a downloadable copy of The Sims 4 on their computer, they are immediately launched into creating their first Sim in a feature aptly named, Create-A-Sim. Create-A-Sim is where the player names a Sim, gives them traits, tattoos, wrinkles, and more. Like myself, avid Sims players know that The Sims 4’s Create-A-Sim system is the best in the franchise. It’s easy to use, dynamic, and incredibly detailed, where you can control the size of your Sims feet and the curvature of the tip of their nose. Players like, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/how-to-create-your-perfect-sim-in-the-sims-4 ">Jackson,</a> add that the customization tools and options are unlimited. There are also hundreds of clothing options for your Sims, and as mentioned in the previous article, The Sims 4 removed many of the boundaries around gender expression where your Sims can get others pregnant or pee standing up, regardless of the gender they present as. It is also important to note that you can make your Sims even more detailed with custom content and mods. There are even opportunities to download other player’s Sims and use them in your game. Create-A-Sim is limitless, and players have many options to create the Sim for whatever story they please. The video below shows a sped-up version of Create-A-Sim and the many details available to players.  </p>

      </center>

      <p>After you create the perfect Sim, players are led to a Neighborhood view where you can choose an empty house, apartment, or lot to move your Sim into. The player now has two options, to begin playing the game and exploring the Neighborhood or world, or build and renovate the home, lot, or apartment they currently own. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdwtdPTYxtw">The Sims community</a> often sections themselves into categories of what they prefer to do most when they boot up their game. Some players prefer making the Sims, building their houses, or actually playing the game. I like to build or renovate homes when I play the game, rather than making Sims or controlling their lives. However, I grew my building skills over the past fifteen years, starting with the first Sims game. My older sister had the game on her bulky desktop computer, a gift from my parents for Christmas during the early 2000s. She played the game constantly, and I would sit and watch her create Sims with the meagre options that came from the base game. She even made our entire family play and build a house, and I was hooked. </p>

			<p>Unfortunately, my first time playing the game on my own, I caused a massive house fire that took out my entire family. My sister was angry with me for touching her stuff, but I was inconsolable because I thought I just killed my family. After this incident, I was banned from the game because I was too young (which was true as the game is rated T for Teens in the United States) to handle the content. After a few years away from The Sims, The Sims 2 was released, and I convinced my family to let me play again and agreed to it with supervision. However, that was when I indeed came to enjoy the game, as it replaced the dolls and toys of my youth. Like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118032000163268">Nutt and Railton</a>, some researchers would say that I never gave up the dolls; I just preferred a digital dollhouse to a physical one. </p>

			<p>The Sims is a much more detailed dollhouse where you can build a new one whenever you tire of the last house in a part of the game called Build/Buy Mode. The Sims 3 was the game that my building skills flourished. They added more content and developed a better interface that made building a core feature of the game, rather than a helpful afterthought as it was in the previous games. However, The Sims 4 was a gamechanger for building homes and allowed the player to pick up rooms and move them, rather than rebuilding an entire home. Another game-changing feature is the ability to copy and paste rooms or move the whole lot without having to rebuild anything. The Sims 4’s home building interface could rival those created for and by architects. You can control foundation heights, roof pitch, landscaping, lighting, and a new feature allows players to create platforms in a home at different levels.</p>

			<p>Below is a juxtaposition of a house built by The Sims Team in the Oasis Springs neighbourhood. Oasis Springs came with The Sims 4 Base Game, and many lots have a mid-century modern feel. Therefore, the house I renovated followed that same style, and with the help of expansion packs and custom content, I was able to create something that more closely followed the design style.</p>
        <center>
        <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="80%" height="650" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=c206a9ec-87d6-11eb-83c8-ebb5d6f907df">
          </iframe>
        </center>

      <p>I also created a sped-up video building a home from scratch rather than a renovation. Like many other Sims players, I create content that is downloadable for other players. There are times I create Sims and upload them to the gallery, but my main interest is sharing my house builds. I have created dozens of homes but only one speed-build video, common in The Sims community. The house below is simply a tiny blue home, made in the Evergreen Harbor neighbourhood from The Eco Lifestyle expansion pack. This expansion pack centred on eco and green living that allows your Sims to control their carbon footprint and the emissions they put out in the world. This pack had many new Create-A-Sim and Build/Buy Mode features. However, the Live Mode made the pack interesting as your Sim could make recycled clothing and furniture, participate in Neighborhood action plans to clean up the surrounding lots, and donate to lobbyists trying to build a greener community. </p>

        <center> <iframe width="80%" height="650" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQ9Ns0xLtsg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
      </center>

      <p>In continuation, Live Mode entails playing the lives of your Sims. You can let them go to school, work, and the hospital. The Sims mimics real life, and most things that occur in our daily lives also happens in the game. The Sims may seem tedious and monotonous to some when they have to complete tasks like feeding their Sims, but you can avoid that easily with cheats and mods to make your Sims happy at all times. There are so many things that Sims can do it’s difficult to dictate which are most important. Content creators added more real-life factors to The Sims 4, like the ability to grow acne, do drugs, or bully enemy Sims.  </p>

      <p>However, it is essential to mention that The Sims 4 was not always a fantastic game and improved over countless free updates and paid-for downloadable content, like expansion packs. Many players like myself feel the game lost many exciting features that made it so famous in the earlier part of the 21st century. At first, the game did not have toddlers, which existed in the past two games. The Sims 4 also had no pools, and they were later added to the game. These issues caused contempt on behalf of the players for the game. The below Tweets show the more significant issue that The Sims 4 is facing: the players genuinely make the game playable.  </p>

      <p>The Sims 4 community is highly engaged with the game. Many are famous content creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch. The Sims 4 also has a readily updated online gallery where players can share the Sims they created and their homes. Moreover, there are countless websites where users can <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/best-sims-4-mods/"> download custom content and mods </a>, like The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims, which are two of the most popular platforms to discover new mods and creators. Researchers and The Sims Team agrees that the players make the game the success that it is today. Without them, the game may have been forgotten about as it highly lacks without any extra content. However, I would still suggest that people who are not self-proclaimed gamers play the game and try the included features to see if they too could be an avid gamer in their own digital dollhouse. </p>
